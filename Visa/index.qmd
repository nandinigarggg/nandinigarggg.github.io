To make the most of my internship at Visa, I knew that I had to be proactive. 
I actively sought out resources in the form of my weekly 
meetings with my manager, daily meetings with my buddy and lots of time spent on the intranet to 
try and get up to speed as quickly as possible. 
Once I was onboarded, I met with various different teams with my buddy and learnt a lot about the ins and out of large scale 
infrastructure management. Soon, I was trusted to manage 133 servers and a budget of $700,000. In addition to this I was asked to
pitch the product in front of a large scale department meeting
