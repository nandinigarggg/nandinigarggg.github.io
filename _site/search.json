I actively sought out resources in the form of my weekly meetings with my manager, daily meetings with my buddy and lots of time spent on the intranet to try and get up to speed as quickly as possible. Once I was onboarded, I met with various different teams with my buddy and learnt a lot about the ins and out of large scale infrastructure management. Soon, I was trusted to manage 133 servers and a budget of $700,000. In addition to this I was asked to pitch the product in front of a large scale department meeting ## Team Dinner"
