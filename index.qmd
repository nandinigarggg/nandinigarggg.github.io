## About Me 

<span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">I am an aspiring Electrical Engineer, eager to learn and push boundaries.</span>
</div>
<div class="centered-content" style="text-align: justify;">


I am an Engineer from Harvey Mudd College graduating this December. 
I enjoy solving challenging and interdisciplinary engineering problems. 
I am always excited to take on new challenges that push the boundaries 
of technology and its applications across industries.



In my free time, I enjoy watching Formula 1, playing tennis, and travelling the world. 
I am also a recent plant mom, who is trying to keep her succulent alive for more than 15 days.
