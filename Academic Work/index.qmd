## Notable Work

In some of my completed courses, I worked on some challenging, interesting, 
and fun final projects. Information about each final project can be found below, 
and the final report for each project is linked. 

**Inverted Pendulum Control System**: A partner and I developed a 
full-state feedback control system that stabilized an inverted pendulum 
on a cart as it moved 1 meter in under 10 seconds.

**Driveshaft Analysis of a Formula SAE RaceCar**: I conducted a material analysis of a driveshaft used on Formula 
SAE vehicles.

**Underwater Submarine**: A team of 3 students and I developed a underwater submarine whose objective was 
to determine the change in salinity of water at Dana Point due to climate change.
