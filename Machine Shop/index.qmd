## Machine Shop Proctor 
As a machine shop proctor at the Harvey Mudd Machine Shop, I had the opportunity to teach over 
100 students every semester how to safely operate machinery in the metal and wood shop. As a shop proctor,
I have helped students in their journeys creating ocarinas and hammers in the shop in safe manner while 
fostering a welcoming environment.
